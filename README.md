# 🔥 Version 0.1 🔥

This is the first version of this Instagram bot. Much more is to come in future and this is just a working beta. It's easy to use and very simple for now. I am planning on adding much more features in the future and automate a lot more processes. My goal is to create a Instagram script which is able to run 24/7 without beeing detected by Instagram.
